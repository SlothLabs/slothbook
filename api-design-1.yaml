/session:
  - POST:
      description: |
        Creates a new session, returning session identification information used for authenticatable requests.
/contacts:
  - GET:
      description: |
        Gets a collection of contacts.
        Each contact item has link information indicating all available actions, including disabled actions (that are marked as such).
        For example, GET and PUT might be available, but DELETE is disabled from the contacts collection.
        On the actual contact resource (mentioned below), DELETE would be enabled as a valid operation.
        Does that make sense? No; no way to determine which actions are triggered from which page. DELETE is included unless disabled due to application state.
        Maybe a particular item isn't editable for some reason, so it's PUT operation is disabled.
